Compositional data are strictly positive multivariate observations carrying only relative information between parts. In 1982, Aitchison proposed to analyse compositionally this type of data using the log-ratio approach. A part of not being strictly positive, different reasons makes multivariate count observations not well suited for being considered compositional.

Different strategies have been considered to analyse multivariate count data as compositional. The first approach consists in replacing the zero by a positive amount. This approach is known as the zero-replacement approach. A second approach consists in modelling the multivariate count observations as obtained by the compounding of a distribution modelling a vector of strictly positive probabilities and the multinomial distribution. Once the distribution is estimated, the latent variables of this process (the strictly positive probabilities) are analysed using the log-ratio approach.

The two most common prior distributions used in the compounding to model multivariate count data are the Dirichlet and the log-ratio-normal distributions, resulting in the Dirichlet-multinomial and Log-ratio-normal-multinomial distributions respectively. Even though the second distribution is superior in terms of modelling, nowadays the process of estimating their parameters is difficult and time-consuming.

In this work we propose to cluster multivariate count data using the compounding approach based on the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. The proposed approach combines Dirichlet-multinomial modelling with classical to cluster real data. Moreover, based on the a priori distribution, we propose a resampling scheme to analyse properties from the final clustering.
